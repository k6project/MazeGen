MAZE GENERATOR

by Eugen (Yevhen) Brusilovskyy

1. DESCRIPTION
This sample project demonstrates implementation of a class, that incapsulates
2D-maze. Maze can be generated by a randomized algorithm, and rendered into a
visible form. This sample implementation can be extended in two terms:

   - Implementing maze generation algorithm, that can be passed to maze building
     function. Sample implementation include recursive division algorithm;

   - Implementing new types of rendering mechanisms implementing MazeRenderer
     interface. Samples include rendering as pattern of ASCII characters, and
     output as JPEG image.

Source code is thoroughly commented using Doxygen notation.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The project was built using GCC with following libraries:
    Boost (ver. 1.50.0), particularly ProgramOptions and Random
    LibJPEG

Additionally, Doxygen (ver. 1.7) is required to buld HTML documentation.

3. BUILD INSTRUCTION
On Linux system change dir:

    ./make

To build documentation:

    ./doxygen
